# 🎨 The Art Nook

> The Art Nook is the very first full-stack web application I’ve ever built entirely on my own — from the first spark of an idea to the last line of code.<br>
> This project reflects more than just code: it shows my ability to **design, implement, and deliver a complete product independently**, learning new skills along the way and pushing through challenges.
> It’s far from perfect, and if I built it today I’d approach many things differently.
> Still, I’m sharing it proudly: as a milestone, a way to track my progress, and a reminder of the motivation that pushed me to start creating.
> Despite its flaws, this project means a lot to me — both as proof that I could bring a full idea to life and as the seed that grew my love for development.

## 🪷 About the project

**The Art Nook** is a warm and welcoming digital platform created to give visibility to emerging artists.  
Developed as my final project for the Web Applications Development Degree (CFGS — DAW), it combines a **solid technical foundation** with a **carefully crafted visual design**.

The platform connects artists with people who appreciate honest, emotional art. Its goal is to provide a space that feels calm, inviting, and easy to navigate — while maintaining full functionality.

## ✨ What I built

- **User authentication**: registration, login, and profile editing  
- **Artwork management**: upload artworks with images, edit and update entries  
- **Discovery features**: browse featured artworks, artists and categories
- **Responsive UI**: mobile-friendly layouts for an optimal experience on all devices  
- **Custom design system**: colors, typography, UI components, and micro-interactions

<br>

## 🔧 Tech stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5 · CSS3 · JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Design & Prototyping:** Figma (high-fidelity prototyping)  
- **Branding & UI:** Custom palette, typography pairing, spacing system.

<br>

## 🖌️ Design approach

> Calm, emotional, personal.

The interface was designed with user emotion and comfort in mind, inspired by the cozy, safe feeling of a reading nook — a special little space on the internet just for art. This concept guided choices like:
- A warm, muted color palette (`#FFF5E1` · `#A3B18C` · `#B86B4B` · `#4D5B6A`)  
- Rounded corners, generous whitespace, and soft shadows  
- **Lato** for clarity, **Playfair Display** for personality  
- Smooth hover states and interaction feedback for a tactile feel
