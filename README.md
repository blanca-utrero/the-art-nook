# 🎨 The Art Nook

> *This is the first fullstack web application I’ve ever built entirely on my own — from the first idea to the final touches. Although it’s far from my best work and I’d structure and organize many things differently today, I’m sharing it proudly as a personal milestone. It’s a snapshot of my progress and a reminder of how much I've learnt along the way. Despite its flaws, it represents something important to me: a beautiful and emotional reason to start creating.*

## 🪷 About the project

**The Art Nook** is a warm and welcoming digital space designed to give visibility to emerging artists.  
It was created as my final project for the Web Applications Development Degree (CFGS - DAW) and is inspired by personal experiences and a desire to make art more accessible.

The platform connects creators with people who appreciate honest, emotional art. It aims to feel calm, close, and carefully designed — offering both functionality and a visually thoughtful experience.

## 🖌️ Design goals

> Calm, emotional, personal.

The UI was carefully crafted based on a custom design system using soft colors, organic spacing, rounded components and typography with character. It’s meant to feel like a “nook” — a cozy place to explore and connect through art.
